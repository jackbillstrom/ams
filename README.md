What is AMS
===========
AMS stands for "Arbetsmarknadsstyrelsen", which now is known as "Arbetsförmedlingen". That is where we are looking for jobs, my purpose with this script was just to learn how I could dump all the employers email-adresses, which later on could be used on how to bulk-email your CV/PM.
